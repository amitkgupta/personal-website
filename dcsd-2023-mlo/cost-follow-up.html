    <h1>Reviewing the Cost of the DCSD 2023 MLO</h1>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>In November 2023, residents of Douglas County, CO were asked to vote on ballot measures 5A and 5B. 5A and 5B  would raise property taxes to provide additional revenue to Douglas County School District (DCSD) for operational and capital expenses, respectively. 5A is primarily supposed to fund salary increases for teachers and other DCSD employees. Voters passed 5A but rejected 5B.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://funding.dcsdk12.org/mlo-bond/arguments-for-and-against">DCSD told residents</a> that passing both 5A and 5B “would increase property taxes by $200 per year for a one-million-dollar home”. As <a target="_blank" href="https://akgupta.ca/dcsd-2023-mlo#what-does-it-cost">predicted</a>, taxes actually increased <b>over $400</b> for a $1M home, and that’s with only 5A passing. Had 5B also passed, taxes would have increased even more, and thus be even further away from the stated $200.</p>
    <p>5A will be funded via an increase to DCSD’s Mill Levy Override (MLO). 5B would have been funded via DCSD’s Bond Redemption Mill Levy. Below is a table showing a selection of properties throughout the county with their property values in 2023 and each property’s increase from 2022 to 2023 for the MLO plus Bond Redemption Mill Levy.</p>

    <p>For the properties in the table above, the average increase in MLO plus Bond Redemption Mill Levy per $1M property value increment is $485. Even excluding the property from District E, which appears to be an outlier, the average increase per $1M increment is $410.</p>
    <p>If you are a Douglas County homeowner, here’s how you can see how much the MLO and bond impacted your property taxes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.douglas.co.us/assessor/#/">Assessor's website</a>.</li>
      <li>Enter your address in the Property Search box.</li>
      <li>Click on the link that says “2023 Est. Taxes”; this should open a new tab.</li>
      <li>In the new tab, look at the “Taxable Assessed Value”.</li>
      <li>Multiply the “Taxable Assessed Value” number by 1.8689%; the result is your 2023 MLO + bond levy.</li>
      <li>Go back to the previous tab on the Assessor’s site showing your property details.</li>
      <li>In the top-left it says “Property Details for 2024”. Click on “2024”; in the dropdown that appears; select “2022”.</li>
      <li>Scroll down the page to where it says “Tax Authorities” and click the small &oplus; icon to expand the section.</li>
      <li>Locate the subsection with Name “Douglas County Re-1 School District” and ID “2001”. Click the &oplus; icon there to expand the subsection for this tax authority.</li>
      <li>Note the amount for “OVERRIDE MILL LEVY” in this subsection.</li>
      <li>Locate the subsection with Name “Douglas County Schools - Debt Service” and ID “2004”. Click the &oplus; icon to expand this subsection.</li>
      <li>Add the amount for “BOND REDEMPTION LEVY” to the amount for “OVERRIDE MILL LEVY” from step 10; the result is your 2022 MLO + bond levy.</li>
      <li>Subtract your 2022 levy from your 2023 levy calculated in step 5; the result is the DCSD MLO and bond tax burden increase for your property.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Is the result higher or lower than what you thought it would be, based on what you heard about 5A and 5B prior to the 2023 election?</p>
    <p>NOTE: The 1.8689% used in step 5 reflects approved mills for DCSD in 2023. 13.485 mills for MLOs plus the 5.204 mills for bond redemptions equals 18.689 mills or 1.8689%.</p>
    <p>NOTE: Your 2022 taxes for MLO and bond redemption are straightforwadly visible on the Assessor's website. The reason it's more complicated for 2023 is that a special, one-off property value reduction of $55,000 was implemented for property tax relief purposes. This is not reflected in the actual value of the property, but is applied for tax calculation purposes. When clicking on "2023 Est. Taxes" in step 2, the new tab shows "Taxable Assessed Value" that takes this $55,000 adjustment into account, whereas the normal property detail page on the Assessor's website shows an Assessed Value which does not take this into account.</p>
